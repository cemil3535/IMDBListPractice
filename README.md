# IMDBListPractice

We create an Imdb - Movie List by performing the steps given below.

Let's create a list where we will list the movies.

Properties for the movie -> Imdb Score (Double) - Name

The user will be asked for an unlimited number of movie names and imdb scores, and objects will be created with this information and the list will be filled.

After each movie addition, the user will be asked whether they want to add a new movie. If the user answers yes, the loop will start over and a new movie will be created and transferred to the relevant list. If the answer is no, the program will be terminated by presenting the following outputs separately.

At the end of the application

List all movies.

List all movies with an imdb score between 4 and 9.

List movies whose names start with 'A' and their imdb scores.
